## Biodigester

A Biodigester is an artificial stomach and anus complete with burps and farts that we can extract hydrocarbon and greenhouse gases from using the Cold Water Gas Extractor from the previous chapter.

Our Biodigester works by rerouting your plumbing into a heated grey water tank and the Biodigester. This is done because we want to extract the heat from the heated grey water and then blow that heat back into the Cold Water Heater chapter.
