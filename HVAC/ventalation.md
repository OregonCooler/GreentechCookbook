### Ventilation

Every house is going to be ventilated differently. Some houses have problem spots such as moisture build up, others are modern with an existing premium solution.

#### Duct Fans

The most important design consideration is the air-flow surface area and air flow in Cubic Feet per minute (CFM), which is dependent on the size of the the fan. Below is a chart of the most common fan sizes and their surface areas.

|      4" / 10 cm       |        6" / 15 cm        |       8" / 20 cm       |
|:-------------------- :|:------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| 12.57in^2 / 78.54cm^2 |  28.27in^2 / 178.72cm^2  | 50.27in^2 / 314.16cm^2 |

When you reduce a duct fan, you can and should reduce a 20 cm to a 15 cm, a 15 cm to a 10 cm, and a 7.5 cm hose to a 5 cm hose. The larger the diameter of the hose, the lower the thermal coefficient and energy loss. The most common fan size is a 6 inch duct fan reduced to a 4 inch duct, which is also the size of a clothing drier intake.
