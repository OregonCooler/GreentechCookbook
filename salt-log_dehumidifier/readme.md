## [Salt-log Dehumidifier](../)

A Salt-log Dehumidifier (SLD) is Thermal Diode that separates moisture from heat using salt, a log, and two fans in a push-pull configuration. Wood is a good material to construct thermal diodes with because it is a thermal insulator and it has tubes in it that the tree uses to carry moisture from the roots to the leaves. You can create two interleaved tubes in a log by cutting one slot that exposes the tubes in the log at zero degrees, if the log is standing up then the saw would be parallel to the ground, and another below it at 90 degrees, another below that at zero degrees followed by another at 90 degrees, repeating this pattern the length of the log. You can use a variety of sealants to seal up the sides of the tube to make them air tight.

One of the tubes gets flooded with saltwater and this causes the moisture in the air to get absorbed by the salt, which then gets absorbed into the wood. A fan blowing dryer air through the other tube then evaporates the moisture using the tubes the tree uses to carry water from the tree's roots to it's leaves. This trick works identically to a refrigerator, in that the phase change of the water vapor from gas to liquid causes the water condensate to deposit it's energy in the salt, and the wood is an insulator, so the effect  that the water goes one way, and the heat goes the other producing a thermal diode that separates water vapor from moisture.

We want to be able to both heat and cool homes with a Cold Water Heater that is detailed in the next chapter but we don't need it to make the SLD. We will use two SLDs to create different circuits that will reroute the moist and dry air streams through different paths given the room is Cold-humid, Cold-dry, Hot-humid, or Hot-dry.
