### Organization

This book is organized into one chapter for each chapter of the book, with each chapter sharing the same progression. Each product starts out with a quick overview of the product that includes what it is, what it does, why it's useful, and what are the basic physics principles it operates on.

The first section of each chapter is the Product Design section that overviews how the Oregon-Cooler model that you can purchase at <https://oregoncooler.org>, but you are encouraged to build your own. You can find the design files for that product in the link in that section. As of the writing of this, all of the design files are very small and can fit in one repo, this is not guaranteed to be the the same in the future if the project design files start to balloon and they require their own repository.

The second section of each chapter is the DIY Guide that details how you can build that particular product using commonly available parts. You can find those parts for sale using the link in that section or at <https://oregoncooler.org/diy>.

The third section of each chapter is the Installation guide. This section instructs you how to install that product into your home or building using the most common scenarios.

All of the design files for the products in this book can be found at <https://github.com/oregon-cooler/oregon-cooler>. Each module has it's own folder, and if that particular module starts to get very big, the folder will become it's own Git repository.
