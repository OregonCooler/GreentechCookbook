### Product Design

This is an open-source project and you are encouraged to build your own DIY version, but there is a pre-build model for sale in our store at <https://oregon-cooler.org/cold-water-heater>. You can find the design files at <https://github.com/oregon-cooler/oregon-cooler/tree/master/modules/cold_water_heater>.

The Oregon-Cooler Cold Water Heater is constructed from some photography-grade or grow lights on a metal plate, a diffuser plate to put in front of the diffusor plate.

There are two approximately one inch hose adapters that feed the air and water into and out of a sprinkler that drips water on the back of the lights in such a way that the water surface area gets maximized with the air being blown upwards through the one inch tubes.
