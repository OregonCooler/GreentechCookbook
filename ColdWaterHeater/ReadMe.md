## Cold Water Heater

A cold-water heater is a water heater that heats water up to room temperature using water and air cooled LED lights and a Salt-log dehumidifier to dehumidify the air coming out of the light. Cold water is pumped from the ground up to the top of the building, then a gravity-feed sprinkler drips water on the back a metal panel with LED light on the other side, and down into a room-temperature water tank that then gets heated on demand.

The goal is to minimize the heat, cooling, and water heating power usage and the Cold water achieves this by exploiting the physics principles of maximizing the surface area of the air in contact with the water, LEDs are most efficient when kept at the lowest possible temperature, water store heat energy, and when water condensates on salt, it deposits it's energy in the salt, and when air gains energy when shaken back and forth in a Salt-log dehumidifier and it adds energy when re-evaporated on the wet side.

The Cold Water Heater is unique in that it can both heat and cool the house with the same hardware. When the air mixes the water and the air together, this causes the house to become thermally coupled to the ground through the water, turning the air conditioning problem into a water heating problem where the ground water now becomes the lowest possible temperature, ensuring the house always stays above freezing.

The method discussed until now is what is referred to as the economizer mode. In order to cool the room faster, ice-cold water condensate, preferably from an Oregon-Cooler, through the Cold Water Heater. A multiplexer of solenoid valves is used to reroute the water condensate and ground water, and the waste heat from the solenoids is just added to the room temperature water.
